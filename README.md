# Fake Harmless Viruses Batch

Welcome to the Fake-Viruses Batch Repository! Here you will find a collection of harmless batch scripts that simulate the appearance of computer viruses. Please note that these scripts are purely for educational and entertainment purposes and do not contain any actual malicious code. They are designed to mimic the behavior of viruses in a safe and controlled environment.

## Disclaimer

I, gtapiGOtLOXP, want to clarify that I had nothing to do with the creation or distribution of actual malicious software. The scripts in this repository are entirely harmless and are meant to showcase basic batch programming techniques rather than causing any harm to your computer or data.

## What's Inside

This repository contains a variety of batch scripts, each demonstrating a different aspect of batch programming. Some scripts may mimic common virus-like behaviors, such as displaying fake error messages, playing sounds, or generating harmless pop-ups. None of these scripts will damage your computer or compromise your data in any way.

## Contributions

While I encourage you to explore the scripts and use them for educational purposes, I do not encourage modifying these scripts for malicious intentions or distributing them as if they were actual viruses. If you have ideas for harmless and creative batch scripts to add to this collection, feel free to submit a pull request.
